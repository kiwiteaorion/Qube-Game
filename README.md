- [ ] Achievement system

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering game graphics
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic and DOM manipulation
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations

### Key Components

- **Game Engine**: Custom-built engine handling:

  - Game loop management
  - State management
  - Event handling
  - Physics calculations

- **Authentication System**:

  - Local storage-based user management
  - Session handling
  - Secure login/logout flow

- **Theme System**:

  - Dynamic theme switching (light/dark)
  - CSS custom properties for consistent styling
  - Theme persistence across sessions

- **Responsive Design**:

  - Flexbox and Grid layouts
  - Media queries for device adaptation
  - Dynamic viewport scaling

- **Asset Management**:
